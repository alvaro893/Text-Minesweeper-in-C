##Hi!
- This is my version of minesweeper made in C for final assignment Programming course.
- Explanation about functions and global variables in *"table.h"* comments.
- The game is a 10x10 table with 10 mines, although it would be possible to change that very easily

The main function is in testProgram.c file

The program works both in windows and linux:
- In windows use visual Studio
- in Linux-like OS compile using the terminal:
```
  make
``` 
- then run the programm using
```
  ./mines
```

There are binaries available!
