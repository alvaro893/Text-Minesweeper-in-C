##Hi!
- This is my version of minesweeper made in C for final assignment Programming course.
- It was made with MS Visual Studio so binaries only work in windows.
- Explanation about functions and global variables in *"table.h"* comments.
- The game is a 10x10 table with 10 mines, although it would be possible to change that very easily

The main function is in testProgram.c file
