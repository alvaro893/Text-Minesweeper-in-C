Hi!
- This is my version of minesweeper wrote in C for final assignment Programming course.
- It was made with MS Visual Studio so only works in windows.
- Explanation about functions and global variables in "table.h" comments.
- The game is a 10x10 table with 10 mines, although it would be possible to change that very easily
